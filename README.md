# image-classification-using-CIFAR10-dataset-in-tensorflow
using convolutional neural network for this image classification problem, 

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset with TensorFlow.
First, a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained as a baseline model.
Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented to show how CNN improves performance on image data.
